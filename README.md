# Livelihood Sentinel 🛡️
AI-powered early warning system for livelihood & financial risk.

**Inversion:** Traditional finance apps track past spending.  
**Livelihood Sentinel flags “risk impacts” early** by converting policy, market, inflation, and weather signals into **personalized alerts + survival protocols**.

---

## Problem
People across diverse livelihoods (students, salaried users, farmers, gig workers, investors) often suffer losses during income shocks because:
- risk information is fragmented and technical
- there is no visibility into *financial runway*
- alerts are not personalized to their assets & liabilities

---

## Solution
Livelihood Sentinel acts as a **Financial Immune System**:
- Calculates **Survival Runway** (days of financial safety left)
- Converts signals into **actionable risk alerts**
- Generates **voice-ready briefings** for accessibility
- Supports **multi-livelihood profiles** (Student mode + Family/Farmer mode)
